While general-purpose messaging apps like WhatsApp allow basic location sharing, they lack specialized safety features and automation that could make the difference in emergency situations.\nOur Solution linkPositionPal transforms the ad-hoc “text when you get home” practice into a comprehensive safety system with features specifically designed for personal security:\nTrusted Groups: Create circles of trusted friends, family members, or colleagues Real-time Location Sharing: Share your precise location with selected groups Route Tracking: Set expected routes and arrival times Automated Alerts: Generate notifications when deviating from planned routes or not reaching destinations on time Emergency Notifications: Quick access to alert trusted contacts in dangerous situations Privacy Controls: Fine-grained permissions for when and with whom your location is shared Getting Started linkThe following sections will guide you through the setup, architecture, and usage of PositionPal, demonstrating how it can become an essential tool in your personal safety toolkit.\n"

These specifications are written in Gherkin using Cucumber, providing a structured and human-readable format that facilitates communication between stakeholders, even for those who have not a technical background.

It is composed of a user and a group, capturing the idea that a user’s state can differ from group to group, enabling group-specific visibility and tracking. Tracking: An entity representing the user’s route information at a certain point in time, it is composed of a list of positions that can be interpolated to form a path between two geographical positions. MonitorableTracking: a specialized Tracking entity that includes the mode of transportation, the destination, the expected arrival time, enabling the system to monitor the user’s route and trigger alerts when necessary. Session: An aggregate root entity storing the overall state of a user in a group at a certain point in time. It acts as a state machine, updating the state and the tracking information based on the received events, ensuring the consistency of the user’s state is maintained. A Snapshot is a value object capturing a snapshot of the user’s state. DomainEvent: An interface representing the base structure of a domain event, capturing the timestamp, the user, and the group in which the event occurs. It is the base type for all the events that occur in the system. DrivingEvent: An interface representing the base structure of a driving event, i.e. a valuable event guiding an application use case. ClientDrivingEvent: A specialized DrivingEvent interface representing the events that are triggered by the user’s actions, such as sampling the location, triggering an SOS alert, starting or stopping a routing. InternalDrivingEvent: A specialized DrivingEvent interface representing the events that are triggered by the system, such as the user going offline, triggering a stuck alert, or a timeout alert. DrivenEvent: An interface representing the base structure of a driven event, i.e. an event triggered by the system as a result of some system state change / action. The application services interfaces are presented in the following diagram, which presents only the main interfaces, leaving out the implementation classes.\nBehavior link As an event driven architecture, the state of each group’s member can be described by the following state diagram, drawing the possible state transitions that can be fired by one of the above DrivingEvent.\n"

                content: "Different types of automated tests, at different granularity, are in place to ensure the correctness of the system, as well as the quality of the software product as a whole.\nThe testing strategy follows Martin Fowler’s Test Pyramid idea, which advocates for a higher number of low-level unit tests that are that are fast and cost-effective, complemented by fewer high-level integration and end-to-end tests that, while slower and more complex, validate the overall system’s functionalities.\nEach type of test has been designed and executed accordingly, as detailed in the following sections.\nArchitectural Testing linkArchUnit have been used to enforce architectural constraints, making sure to adhere to the Hexagonal architecture (also known as Onion architecture or Ports and Adapters), preventing unwanted dependencies, maintaining separation of concerns and ensuring architectural decisions are consistently followed over time.\nAn example of arch unit test specification and rules used is shown below and can be found here.\n\"Project-wise architecture\" should \"adhere to ports and adapters, a.k.a onion architecture\" in: val locationGroup = \"io.github.positionpal.location\" val code = ClassFileImporter().importPackages(locationGroup) onionArchitecture() .domainModels(s\"$locationGroup.commons..\", s\"$locationGroup.domain..\") .applicationServices(s\"$locationGroup.application..\", s\"$locationGroup.presentation..\") .adapter(\"real time tracker component\", s\"$locationGroup.tracking..\") .adapter(\"storage\", s\"$locationGroup.storage..\") .adapter(\"message broker\", s\"$locationGroup.messages..\") .adapter(\"gRPC API\", s\"$locationGroup.grpc..\") .adapter(\"web sockets and http web API\", s\"$locationGroup.ws..\") .ignoreDependency(havingEntrypointAsOrigin, andAnyTarget) .because(\"`Entrypoint` submodule contains the main method wiring all the adapters together.\") .ensureAllClassesAreContainedInArchitectureIgnoring(havingEntrypointAsOrigin) .withOptionalLayers(true) .check(code) private def havingEntrypointAsOrigin = DescribedPredicate.describe[JavaClass](\"in `entrypoint` package\", _.getPackage.getName.contains(\"entrypoint\")) private def andAnyTarget = DescribedPredicate.alwaysTrue() This uses the onionArchitecture rule to enforce the following architectural constraints:\nthe domainModels contains all the domain entities and do not depend on any other layer; the applicationServices contains all the application services that are needed to run the application and use cases. They can use and see only the domain models and no other layer; the adapters modules contains logic to connect to external systems and/or infrastructure. They can see and use both the domain models and the application services, but no adapter can depend on another one. the only exception applies to the entrypoint package that contains the main application entrypoint and, thus, need to see and use the various adapters to wire all up together. Unit tests linkUnit tests, which sit at the lowest level of the testing pyramid, focus on verifying that small pieces of code—often individual classes—behave as expected.\nLeveraging testing DSLs frameworks like Kotest and ScalaTest tests can be crafted in a clear and succinct way, enhancing their comprehensibility and maintenance.\nIntegration tests linkVale–\nRequires bring up the single components like RabbitMQ, Cassandra…\nEnd-to-End tests linkEnd-to-End tests are the heaviest and slowest tests, as they validate the system as a whole, simulating real user interactions and scenarios.\nThese tests are placed in the access point of the system, i.e., the API gateway, and to be run against the whole system requires the local deployment of all the services along with a mocked version of the client app to make it possible to test real system notifications and interactions in a controlled and repeatable way.\nFor this purpose a local deployment infrastructure has been set up using Docker Compose (more details on the Deployment section) with a custom template resolution strategy to allow the gateway test lifecycle to:\npackage in a Docker image the gateway service with the latest changes; package the mocked client application in a Docker image; bring up all the system microservices along with the gateway and the mocked client application; run the end-to-end tests against the system; tear down the whole system. As presented in the Domain Analysis section, the system has been end-to-end validated and tested using Gherking and Cucumber-JS libraries, along with Puppeteer for browser automation and interactions.\nAn example of a feature implementation is presented hereafter:\nWhen(\"I have arrived at the destination\", async () =\u003e { await this.hanWs.send(JSON.stringify(sample(global.han.userData.id, global.astro.id, cesenaCampusLocation))); }); Then(\"the routing is stopped\", { timeout: 20_000 }, async () =\u003e { await eventually(async () =\u003e { expect( receivedUpdates.some((update) =\u003e update.UserUpdate.user === global.han.userData.id \u0026\u0026 update.UserUpdate.status === \"Active\" ), ).to.be.true; }, 15_000); }); Then(\"my state is updated to `Active`\", { timeout: 15_000 }, async () =\u003e { await eventually(async () =\u003e { await expectSuccessfulGetRequest( `/api/session/state/${global.astro.id}/${global.han.userData.id}`, global.han.token, { status: { code: \"OK\" }, state: \"ACTIVE\", }, ); }, 10_000); }); The full suite of end-to-end features and tests can be found here and the report of the last run can be found below:\nStress Test linkGio–\nQuality Assurance linkFor all the projects and repositories, depending on the language they are developed in, different Quality Assurance (QA) tools have been used to validate the quality of the codebase. These tools ensure adherence to coding standards, maintainability, and early detection of potential issues, if appropriately integrated into Continuous Integration (as per DevOps best practices).\nThe following tools have been used for Scala:\nScalafmt: a code formatter ensuring consistency in code style across the project; Scalafix: a tool for refactoring and linting Scala code, allowing automated fixes for common issues and ensuring best practices. The following tools have been employed for Kotlin:\nktlint: a linter and formatter that enforces Kotlin coding standards automatically; detekt: a static code analysis tool for Kotlin that helps identify code smells, complexity issues, and potential security risks. For Javascript, ESLint, a static analysis tool that enforces coding style rules and detects problematic patterns in JavaScript code.\nTo further improve code quality and reliability, aggressive compilation options have been used across all projects. These options ensure that all warnings are treated as errors, preventing the introduction of potential issues into the codebase. This approach enforces strict compliance with best practices and minimizes the risk of overlooking important warnings that could lead to runtime errors or degraded maintainability.\nBy integrating these QA tools and enforcing strict compilation settings, the project maintains high code quality, reduces technical debt, and ensures consistency across different languages and repositories.\nFor more details on the QA tools and configuration used please refer to the DevOps section.\n"

It allows backend services to communicate with client applications by delivering messages efficiently and securely.\nFCM has been chosen over plain WebSockets, which are already used in the system for the real-time tracking of the user’s position, due to several compelling reasons aligned with our specific requirements and infrastructure goals:\nOffline message handling\nOne of the core requirements for the notification service was to ensure message delivery even when users are temporarily offline or the client application is not in foreground.\nFCM natively supports these features: it delivers messages directly to the device’s system tray, allowing users to interact with them to bring the application back to the foreground. If the device is offline, FCM temporarily queues the messages and ensures their delivery as soon as the device reconnects. These features guarantees that users receive all relevant notifications without requiring additional queuing mechanisms.\nScalability and reliability\nFCM is built on Google’s infrastructure, offering seamless scalability without requiring to manage servers, load balancers, or clustering mechanisms. It can handle millions of messages per day effortlessly, with built-in queuing and retry mechanisms for undelivered messages.\nOn the other hand, WebSocket infrastructure demands significant engineering effort to manage load balancing and scaling.\nSecurity and Authentication\nFirebase Cloud Messaging employs OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication of API requests, ensuring that only authorized services can send messages. All communications are encrypted using TLS by default, simplifying compliance with security standards.\nAligned with Use Case: One-Way Notifications\nThe primary function of the notification service is to send one-way notifications from backend systems to users’ devices, not to enable full-duplex communication. FCM is purpose-built for this scenario, providing optimized delivery for both notification messages (visible alerts) and data messages (background processing).\nWhile WebSockets shine in scenarios requiring continuous, bidirectional communication—such as chat apps or live data feeds—they add unnecessary complexity for our needs, where responses from clients are not required.\nLifecycle flow linkThe lifecycle of a push notification message follows these steps:\nThe client app registers the device to FCM, obtaining a registration token that uniquely identifies the app instance. This is direct client app responsibility; The client sends the registration token to the notification service, associating it with the user’s account, through a gRPC API; When a new notification is triggered by one of the other microservices through the message broker, a notification message is composed and sent to the FCM backend using the registration token; The FCM backend delivers the message to the device with the corresponding registration token. In this process, the notification service is responsible for handling the registration and invalidation of device tokens, as well as the composition and delivery of notification messages to the FCM backend.\nNotifications Publisher linkThe logic for sending notifications is encapsulated in the fcm adapter module.\n/** * A notifications publisher sending notifications using Firebase Cloud Messaging. */ class FirebaseCloudNotificationPublisher( private val firebase: Firebase, private val usersTokensRepository: UsersTokensRepository, groupsRepository: GroupsRepository, ) : BasicNotificationPublisher(groupsRepository) { override suspend fun send(message: NotificationMessage, userIds: Set) = userIds.map { usersTokensRepository.get(it) }.forEach { it.mapCatching { userTokens -\u003e userTokens.forEach { userToken -\u003e firebase.sendMessage(userToken.token, message) } }.onFailure { err -\u003e logger.error(\"Failure in sending notification {}: {}\", message, err.message) } } private companion object { private val logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(this::class.java) } } /** * A Firebase client facade to send notifications. */ class Firebase private constructor(private val app: FirebaseMessaging) { /** * Configuration for the Firebase client. * @property serviceAccountFilePath The absolute path to the service account file. */ data class Configuration( val serviceAccountFilePath: String, ) /** Sends the given [notificationMessage] using the specified [token]. */ fun sendMessage(token: Token, notificationMessage: NotificationMessage) = runCatching { val notification = Notification.builder() .setTitle(notificationMessage.title()) .build() val message = Message.builder() .setNotification(notification) .putData(\"title\", notificationMessage.title()) .putData(\"body\", notificationMessage.body()) .setToken(token) .build() app.send(message) } /** A factory for creating instances of [Firebase]. */ companion object { private const val APP_ID = \"notification-service\" /** Creates a new instance of [Firebase] using the given [configuration]. */ fun create(configuration: Configuration): Result = runCatching { val serviceAccountFilePath = File(configuration.serviceAccountFilePath) .takeIf { it.exists() \u0026\u0026 it.isFile \u0026\u0026 it.extension == \"json\" } ?.absolutePath ?: error(\"${configuration.serviceAccountFilePath} is not present or is not a valid account file!\") val credentials = GoogleCredentials.fromStream(FileInputStream(serviceAccountFilePath)) val options = FirebaseOptions.builder() .setCredentials(credentials) .build() return Result.success(Firebase(FirebaseMessaging.getInstance(FirebaseApp.initializeApp(options, APP_ID)))) } } } API (:grpc) linkThe client can register the device token obtained from FCM to the notification service through a gRPC API, whose protobuf definition is as follows:\nservice UsersTokensService { rpc Register(UserToken) returns (EmptyResponse); rpc Invalidate(UserToken) returns (EmptyResponse); } message UserToken { string user = 1; string token = 2; } message Status { StatusCode code = 1; optional string message = 2; } enum StatusCode { OK = 0; CONFLICT = 1; NOT_FOUND = 2; GENERIC_ERROR = 3; } message EmptyResponse { Status status = 1; } "
